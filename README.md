# A Level Resources
This is a collection of all the flashcards and files I created during my A-levels. They have been mostly untouched since my A-levels. I have made them open to share after receiving many requests.

## Table of Contents
- [Downloading the Files](#downloading-the-files)
- [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)
- [Roadmap](#roadmap)

## Downloading the Files
You can find the download page under [releases](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/a-level-resources/releases) on the right hand side of the page. Make sure you download the latest release by pressing the first  `Source code` button on the page. You can then extract the folder and files and get studying!

Be sure to bookmark the releases page and check it regularly for updates (or make a GitHub account and watch this repository by pressing the `Watch` button on the top right).

## Reporting Issues
If you find any mistakes in any notes or flashcards then either make a GitHub account and create an issue under the issues tab of this repository or email me at `r (at) rayamjad.com`.
